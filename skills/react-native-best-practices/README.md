# React Native Best Practices Skill

Production patterns for React Native apps on the New Architecture, by [Software Mansion](https://swmansion.com/).

Add this skill to give your AI coding agent accurate, current guidance for Software Mansion's React Native libraries: Reanimated, Gesture Handler, React Native SVG, ExecuTorch, Audio API, and more.

## Sub-skills

| Sub-skill | Covers | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| [Animations](./references/animations/) | Reanimated 4, CSS transitions, CSS animations, shared values, layout animations, 120fps, performance flags | Complete |
| [Gestures](./references/gestures/) | Gesture Handler: tap, pan, pinch, rotation, swipe, long press, drag | Stub |
| [SVG](./references/svg/) | React Native SVG: vector graphics, icons, charts, illustrations | Stub |
| [Haptics](./references/haptics/) | Tactile feedback, vibration patterns, impact/notification haptics | Stub |
| [On-device AI](./references/on-device-ai/) | React Native ExecuTorch: LLMs, computer vision, OCR, speech, embeddings | Complete |
| [Multimedia](./references/multimedia/) | Video playback and streaming | Stub |
| [Rich Text](./references/rich-text/) | Rich text editing with react-native-enriched: formatting toolbar, mentions, links | Complete |
| [Multithreading](./references/multithreading/) | Worklets, background processing, offloading computation | Stub |
| [Audio](./references/audio/) | React Native Audio API: playback, recording, visualization, sessions | Complete |
| [Radon MCP](./references/radon-mcp/) | Radon IDE MCP tools: screenshots, logs, component tree, network inspector, reload, docs | Complete |

**Complete** = full reference documentation with code examples. **Stub** = frontmatter and description only, reference content coming soon.

## Adding a Sub-skill

1. **Create the directory**: `references/<your-topic>/`
2. **Write `SKILL.md`** with frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: your-topic
   description: "What it covers and when to trigger. Include specific keywords users might type."
   ---
   ```
3. **Add reference files** for detailed patterns and code examples
4. **Register it** in the parent `SKILL.md` sub-skills table
5. **Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines**. Move detailed content to reference files and link to them with a "when to read" table.
