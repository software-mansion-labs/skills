# React Native Best Practices Skill

Production patterns for React Native apps on the New Architecture, by [Software Mansion](https://swmansion.com/).

Add this skill to give your AI coding agent accurate, current guidance for Software Mansion's React Native libraries: Reanimated, Gesture Handler, React Native SVG, ExecuTorch, Audio API, and more.

## Sub-skills

| [Gestures](./references/gestures/) | Gesture Handler: tap, pan, pinch, rotation, fling, hover, long press, Pressable, RectButton, Swipeable, DrawerLayout, gesture composition, testing | Complete |
| [SVG](./references/svg/) | React Native SVG: when to use, installation, performance, animated SVG with Reanimated | Complete |
| [On-device AI](./references/on-device-ai/) | React Native ExecuTorch: LLMs, computer vision, OCR, speech, text/image embeddings, model management | Complete |
| [Rich Text](./references/rich-text/) | Rich text editing with react-native-enriched, Markdown rendering with react-native-enriched-markdown | Complete |
| [Multithreading](./references/multithreading/) | react-native-worklets: Worker Runtimes, scheduling APIs, shared memory, Serializable, Synchronizable | Complete |
| [Audio](./references/audio/) | React Native Audio API: playback, recording, visualization, audio sessions | Complete |

## Adding a Sub-skill

1. **Create the directory**: `references/<your-topic>/`
2. **Write `SKILL.md`** with frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: your-topic
   description: "What it covers and when to trigger. Include specific keywords users might type."
   ---
   ```
3. **Add reference files** for detailed patterns and code examples
4. **Register it** in the parent `SKILL.md` sub-skills table
5. **Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines**. Move detailed content to reference files and link to them with a "when to read" table.
