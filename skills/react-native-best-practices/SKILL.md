# React Native Best Practices

Software Mansion's production patterns for React Native apps on the New Architecture.

Read the relevant sub-skill for the topic at hand. All sub-skills are in `references/`.

## Sub-skills

| Sub-skill | When to use |
|-----------|------------|
| `references/animations/SKILL.md` | CSS transitions, CSS animations, shared value animations, GPU shader animations (WebGPU, TypeGPU), layout animations (entering/exiting, transitions, keyframes), scroll-driven animations, animation functions (withSpring, withTiming, withDecay), core hooks (useSharedValue, useAnimatedStyle), interpolation, particle systems, procedural noise, SDF rendering, animation performance, 120fps, accessibility, Reanimated 4 |
| `references/gestures/SKILL.md` | Tap, pan, pinch, rotation, swipe, long press, fling, hover, drag, Pressable, RectButton, Swipeable, DrawerLayout, VirtualGestureDetector, gesture composition, gesture testing -- any touch interaction with Gesture Handler |
| `references/svg/SKILL.md` | Vector graphics, icons, charts, illustrations using React Native SVG |
| `references/on-device-ai/SKILL.md` | On-device AI: LLMs, computer vision, OCR, audio processing, text/image embeddings |
| `references/rich-text/SKILL.md` | Rich text editor, formatted text input, WYSIWYG, mentions, Markdown renderer, react-native-enriched, react-native-enriched-markdown |
| `references/multithreading/SKILL.md` | Multithreading, react-native-worklets, background processing, Worker Runtimes, UI thread, scheduleOnUI, scheduleOnRN, Serializable, Synchronizable, offloading computation from the JS thread |
| `references/audio/SKILL.md` | Audio playback, recording, music players, audio sessions |
