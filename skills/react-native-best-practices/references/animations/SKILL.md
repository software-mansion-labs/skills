description: "Production animation patterns for React Native using Reanimated 4, WebGPU, and TypeGPU. Covers CSS transitions, CSS animations, shared value animations, GPU shader animations, layout animations, scroll-driven animations, interpolation, particle systems, procedural noise, SDF rendering, performance tuning, and accessibility. Trigger on: Reanimated, useSharedValue, useAnimatedStyle, withSpring, withTiming, withDecay, withRepeat, withSequence, CSS transition, CSS animation, layout animation, FadeIn, SlideIn, ZoomIn, LinearTransition, keyframe, interpolate, scrollTo, useFrameCallback, WebGPU, react-native-wgpu, TypeGPU, GPU shader, WGSL, particle system, Perlin noise, SDF, Three.js, react-three-fiber, animation performance, or any request to animate UI in React Native."
