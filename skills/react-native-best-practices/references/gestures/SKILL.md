# React Native Gesture Handler

Software Mansion's production gesture patterns for React Native using Gesture Handler. Never suggest `PanResponder` when RNGH is available — it runs on the JS thread and is effectively deprecated.

## Version Decision Tree

```
Check package.json - "react-native-gesture-handler" version
   │
   ├── user asks to migrate v2 -> v3 - install gesture-handler-3-migration skill
   ├── starts with "2." - use builder API (default)
   └── starts with "3." - use hook API (beta)
```

## Setup
- Wrap app in `<GestureHandlerRootView>`. With navigation libraries (React Navigation, Expo Router, react-native-navigation), wrap each screen at registration time.

## Critical Rules

`useMemo` every gesture - without it, gesture objects recreate on every render, causing recognizers to re-attach and lose state:

```tsx
const pan = useMemo(() => Gesture.Pan().onBegin(...).onUpdate(...).onEnd(...), []);
```

Scroll containers — use `RectButton` (not `TouchableOpacity` or `Pressable`). Also import `ScrollView`/`FlatList` from `react-native-gesture-handler`, not `react-native`:

```tsx
import { ScrollView, FlatList, RectButton } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';
```
